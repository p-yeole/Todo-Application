Welcome to Todo application!

**Deployed Link [Netlify] :** (https://lovely-faloodeh-b00226.netlify.app/)

This is where you can create your todo's, mark them as done or delete them as and when required. It uses ```localStorage``` for saving your todo's, so that even if you reload/restart the browser, your todo's remains the same.

The entire application is developed using ```Angular framework``` and some ```Bootstrap classes``` are also used for ```Responsive design.```
