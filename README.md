# Todo-Application

Welcome to Todo application!
**[Netlify] Deployed Link:** (https://lovely-faloodeh-b00226.netlify.app/)

This is where you can create your todo's, mark them as done or delete them as and when required. It uses localStorage for saving your todo's, so that even if you reload/restart the browser, your todo's remains the same.

The entire application is developed using ```diff+**Angular framework**``` and some ```diff+**bootstrap classes**``` are also used for ```diff+**responsive design**.```
